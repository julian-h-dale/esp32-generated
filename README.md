Sure, here's an example README.md file for the ESP32 web server code:

# ESP32 Web Server with MicroPython

This is an example code for creating a web server using the ESP32 and MicroPython. The server responds to incoming client requests with a simple HTML page displaying "Julian Dale" in H1 text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you will need:

- An ESP32 board
- MicroPython firmware flashed on the board
- An IDE or text editor that supports MicroPython (e.g., uPyCraft, Thonny, Visual Studio Code)

### Installing

1. Clone this repository or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Copy the `main.py` file to the root directory of your ESP32 board.
3. (Optional) Create a `.env` file to store your WiFi network credentials (see below).

### Usage

1. Power on your ESP32 board.
2. Connect to the board's WiFi network.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to the board's IP address (e.g., http://192.168.1.100).
4. You should see a simple HTML page displaying "Julian Dale" in H1 text.

### Setting WiFi Credentials

To set your WiFi network credentials, create a `.env` file in the same directory as the `main.py` file, with the following content:

```
SSID=your_SSID
PASSWORD=your_password
```

Replace `your_SSID` and `your_password` with your actual network credentials. The `main.py` file will read these values from the environment variables and use them to connect to the WiFi network.

## Built With

- MicroPython - A lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language
- ESP32 - A series of low-cost, low-power system-on-a-chip microcontrollers from Espressif Systems
